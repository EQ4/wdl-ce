# WDL/IPlug Community Edition

This project is a community maintained version of WDL/IPlug (originally by [Cockos](http://www.cockos.com/wdl/)). 

WDL "is a free and open source C++ library that is designed to be easily used by other code". For more info see the [Cockos WDL Home](http://www.cockos.com/wdl/).

IPlug (part of WDL) is a cross platform framework for developing VST and Audiounit plugins. The WDL/IPlug Community Edition is an initiative started by a group of plugin developers with the goal of improving the framework which means... 

* filling in missing features
* fixing bugs
* making it easier for new developers to use

Since Cockos are updating and maintaining their version of WDL, which is used in their products, it is likely that this community version will avoid making significant changes to code that is not directly part of IPlug itself, in order to maintain compatibility with the Cockos WDL core.

Discuss WDL and IPlug on [the WDL forum](http://forum.cockos.com/forumdisplay.php?f=32)

WDL-CE shares the same license as the Cockos edition (see below). You must be comfortable with this if you plan to contribute. Please also see individual header files for any additional license information.
